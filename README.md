## ✨ Features

- **Whole-album downloads** — grab an entire album, profile photo set, or group gallery in one click
- **Carousel grabs** — pull every photo from the Facebook photo viewer
- **Direct-to-disk** — saves to a folder you pick via the File System Access API (no zip step)
- **Format conversion** — export as JPG, PNG, or WEBP
- **Custom naming** — file-name and folder-name templates
- **Resume** — interrupted downloads pick up where they left off
- **Skip duplicates** — remembers already-downloaded files
- **Captions** — optional `.caption.txt` sidecar files
- **Gentle mode** — configurable per-request delay to respect rate limits
- **Private by design** — everything runs locally; the extension makes zero calls to any first-party server

## 🚀 Install (from source)

1. Download the latest `stashly-vX.Y.Z.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/shahriar-ahmed-seam/bulkFb-media-download/releases) and unzip it — **or** clone this repo.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome (or any Chromium browser).
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` folder (the one containing `manifest.json`).
5. Open Facebook, go to an album / profile photos / group photos page — the **Stashly** button appears automatically.

> Requires Chrome 103+ for the File System Access API and MV3 dynamic content scripts.

## 🖱️ Usage

1. Navigate to a Facebook album, a profile's photos, a group's photos, or open a photo in the viewer.
2. Click the **Stashly** download button that appears in the page.
3. Choose options (format, naming, delay, resume…), then pick a destination folder.
4. Let it run — progress shows inline, and you can stop any time.

The toolbar **popup** shows live status and stats; the **options page** lets you
review activity and clear download history or resume points.

## 🛠️ Development

No build step is needed to run the extension — `extension/` loads directly as an
unpacked extension. Tooling is dependency-free (Node built-ins only).

```bash
npm test       # run the unit + integrity test suite (Node's built-in runner)
npm run build  # package extension/ into dist/stashly-v<version>.zip
```

The non-trivial background logic lives in pure, `chrome`-free modules
(`background/match-pattern.js`, `background/storage-actions.js`) so it can be
unit-tested in plain Node. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## ❓ FAQ

**Is my data sent anywhere?** No. Stashly has no backend. Downloads use your own
authenticated Facebook session and the File System Access API. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

**Why does it need to remove CSP headers?** Facebook's Content-Security-Policy
blocks injected scripts. Stashly removes it only on `facebook.com` so its UI can run.

**The download button disappeared / errors out.** Facebook frequently changes its
internal module and GraphQL identifiers, which this kind of tool depends on. Updates
may be required when that happens — please [open an issue](https://github.com/shahriar-ahmed-seam/bulkFb-media-download/issues).

**Will this be on the Chrome Web Store?** Possibly, but not guaranteed — extensions
that modify Facebook and remove CSP headers carry review risk. For now, install from source.
